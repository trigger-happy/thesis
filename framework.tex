\subsection*{Framework}
\subsubsection*{Definition of Terms}
There are a lot of terms that will be used throughout this paper.
The following terms however are central and should therefore be defined clearly
to avoid any misconceptions and misunderstandings.
%put these on bullet points
-Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). A Graphics Processing Unit or GPU is special type
of computer device that deals with the processing of graphics that will be displayed
on screen. It is similar to a Central Processing Unit or CPU in their ability to execute
a sequence of instructions over a set of data. The difference however is that while the
CPU is capable of executing a wide range of instructions, the GPU is specialized to perform
highly intensive mathematical computations and over a large set of data.
-Genetic Algorithm (GA). Genetic Algorithms are part of a special family of algorithms
called Stochastic Search Algorithms, also known in simple terms as randomized search. GAs
follow the nature's pattern of evolution and the concept of "survival of the fittest." Given
a random set of solutions, each one is evaluated and then scored according to a fitness function.
Solutions that obtain the best scores become part of the next generation of solutions while the
rest are replaced through reproduction (mixing elements of one solution with another solution).
Eventually, only the most "fit" of solutions will be part of the final generation of solutions.


\subsubsection*{Variables of the Study}
%Also put these on bullet points
-Time it takes for an acceptable solution to be found as compared to
a pure CPU solution
-Performance of the AI evolved from the GPU as compared to a hand tuned solution
