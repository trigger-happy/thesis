\subsubsection*{Context of the Study}
Majority of today's computer games make use of computer controlled agents to serve a wide
variety of purposes. Some of these agents are used as simple props like common animals that
can be found in the wilderness. Others serve a bigger purpose as characters that either assist
or oppose the player in the game. The wide variety of complexity that these artificially
intelligent agents can have has lead to the development of an equally wide variety of techniques.
These techniques were developed with the goal of making these AI agents act realistically and reduce
the time it takes to develop these AI agents.
