Floods and landslides caused by heavy rains are regular occurrences in the Philippines. However, the damage caused by natural disasters can be lessened if people within the affected areas can prepare for these disasters. By the use of wireless communication networks to gather rain data, the distribution and intensity of rain may be visualized through an online weather map. Through this tool, areas that will experience heavy rains can be pinpointed. In this paper, we present a real time rain visualization tool that will display the rain telemetry of a specific location at a given time through dynamically moving bar graphs. Together with this, we also discuss its capability to serve as an early warning system for impending disasters caused by heavy rain and its potential to develop into a weather forecasting and landslide detection system.
