Genetic algorithms have been applied to enhance Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
games. However, the biggest limiting factor in the use of genetic algorithms
has been the large amount of time it takes for an acceptable solution to evolve
after numerous generations. In light of this, we present a solution to speed up
the process by making use of the parallel computing capabilities of the Graphics
Processing Unit.
