\section*{Abstract}
Genetic algorithms have been applied to enhance AI in games. The biggest
limiting factor however in the use of genetic algorithms has been the large amount of 
time it takes for an acceptable solution to evolve after numerous generations.
In light of this, we present a solution to speed up the process by making use of the
parallel computing capabilities of the Graphics Processing Unit.
