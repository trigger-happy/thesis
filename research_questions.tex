\subsubsection*{Research Questions}
These are the questions that should be addressed in designing the application:
\begin{itemize}
 \item How should the AI be represented as a genome for the purpose of evolution?

 \item How do we structure the game such that most of the code may be shared between
the actual game and the offline tool?

 \item Under what specific criteria should we judge an individual solution for use in the
fitness function?

 \item How practical is this solution compared to a pure CPU implementation?
\end{itemize}
