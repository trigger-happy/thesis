\subsubsection*{Research Questions}
These are the questions that should be addressed in designing the application:

\begin{itemize}
 \item How should the AI be represented as a genome for the purpose of evolution in a genetic algorithm?

 \item How do we structure the game such that most of the code may be shared between
the actual game and the offline tool that utilizes the GPU?

 \item Under what specific criteria should we judge an individual solution for use in the
fitness function?

 \item How practical is this solution compared to a pure CPU implementation?
\end{itemize}


The following questions are for determining if the application proves our theory
in making use of GPUs for evolving AI solutions to a game:

\begin{itemize}
 \item How much faster is the GPU assisted solution as compared to the pure CPU
 version?
 
 \item How well did the evolved AI solutions perform in the actual game?
 
 \item Is it possible to re-use portions of the code for evolving the AI for other
 types of games?
\end{itemize}
