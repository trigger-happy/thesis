\chapter{CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS}

\subsection{Conclusion}
Genetic algorithm is a powerful tool for AI creation. It can find the optimal
solution to a given problem. The only limitation it has would be the time it 
requires to produce a usable output. We proposed that using a
GPU can shorten the time it takes to generate results. We have collected the
seed, processor, and time data. The data was analysed and found that the results
were not a type 1 error, false positive error. We have proven that the GPU is faster
in manipulating game AI than the CPU.

\subsection{Recommendations}
Although we have proven that the GPU is indeed faster than the CPU, we have not
been able to optimize the code extensively for both the CPU and GPU. Possible 
optimizations for the GPU include making use of shared memory to speed up memory
accesses. On the other hand, the CPU can benefit from using intrinsics to speed
up some of the calculations.
